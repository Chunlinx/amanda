# AMANDA  #

This repository contains the source code of the Neural Reading Comprehension-based Question Answering system, AMANDA, which is published in AAAI 2018.

### Overview  ###

We experimented on three datasets: NewsQA, TriviaQA and SearchQA. Source code is available in the corresponding directories (`NEWSQA`, `TRIVIAQA`, and `SEARCHQA`) for training and testing on every dataset. Additionally, each of the directories contains a separate README file for further details.
`amanda/` contains the source code of the model architecture.
